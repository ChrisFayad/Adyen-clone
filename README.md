# Adyen-clone

**This Website is the Project of HTML/CSS week3 Homework for HYF Class34!**

I choose Adyen website to clone & I used Materialize CSS framework to do so. However, I think that make me lose a lot of time, put more effort & the most important thing that is limited me in so many places.
For example, I managed only to make the dropdown menu work on the main menu, not the sidenav. In addition, the collapsible only direction is down, I couldn't use it to mimic the exact act they had on their website!
From my little experience, I think Bootstrap is easier to use, has more support and give more freedom to modify their components.
